Backup with mysqldump:
mysqldump -u mpgagolf -h mpgagolf.mysql.pythonanywhere-services.com 'mpgagolf$bhmc' > ${FILE}

Restore:
Restoring a MySQL database using mysqldump is simple.
To restore the database, you must create an empty database.
First, let us drop and recreate the sakila database by executing the following command.

mysql> drop database sakila;
Query OK, 24 rows affected (0.35 sec)
mysql> create database sakila;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)
MySQL>
When you restore the database, instead of using mysqldump, you must use mysql;
otherwise, the mysqldump will not generate the schema and the data.
Execute the following command to restore the sakila database:

mysql -u root -p sakila < C:\MySQLBackup\sakila_20200424.sql
Once command executes successfully, execute the following command to verify that all objects have been created on the sakila database.

mysql> use sakila;
Database changed
mysql> show tables;
